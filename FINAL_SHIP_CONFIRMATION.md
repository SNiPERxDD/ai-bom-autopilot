## üìã Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deployment (Configuration Only)
1. **Environment Setup**: Configure `.env` with valid credentials
   - TiDB Serverless connection details
   - OpenAI or Gemini API keys
   - Slack webhook URL (optional)
   - Jira credentials (optional)

2. **Database Initialization**: Run migrations
   ```bash
   python -m core.db.migrations up
   ```

3. **System Verification**: Check health endpoint
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000/health
   ```

### Deployment Commands
```bash
# Complete setup and startup
./run.sh

# Manual startup (alternative)
python -m apps.api.main &
streamlit run apps/ui/streamlit_app.py
```
